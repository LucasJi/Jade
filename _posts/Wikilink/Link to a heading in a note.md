You can link to specific headings in notes, also known as *anchor links*.

To link to a heading, add a hash (`#`) at the end of the link destination, followed by the heading text.

For example, [[Demo#Heading 1]].

You can add multiple hash symbols for each subheading.

For example, [[Demo#Heading 2#Heading 2.2]].
