## Resolve markdown files to html files

With the help of React library [react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown), I can easily turn my markdown file into HTML page.

## Home Page

1. Show an avatar in the center of the page
2. Slogan:  
   My slogan is _**You are more than what you have become!**_. It's from "The Lion King". I want to apply an animation effect to the slogan. Here are some thoughts:
   - Use a typewriter animation. Show the whole slogan character by character.
   - ~~Show the entire slogan from random characters.~~
