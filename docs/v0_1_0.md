## Resolve markdown files to html files

With the help of React library [react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown), I can easily turn my markdown file into HTML page.

## Home Page

1. Show an avatar in the center of the page
2. Slogan:  
   My slogan is _**You are more than what you have become!**_. It's from "The Lion King". I want to apply an animation effect to the slogan. Here are some thoughts:
   - Use a typewriter animation. Show the whole slogan character by character.
   - ~~Show the entire slogan from random characters.~~

## Resolve all/specific markdowns in Obsidian vault

Since I won't write my blogs in a browser but some more professional softwares like Obsidian, I want my blog website has the ability to read my Obsidian vault directly and resolve all markdowns to HTML files.

Why not use some static website generators to generate the blog website? That's because Obsidian has many wonderful features like graph view, back links and outgoing links which helps me better organize my knowledge. I hope my blog website can have the same features with Obsidian.
