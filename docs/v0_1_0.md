## Resolve markdown files to html files

With the help of React library [react-markdown](https://github.com/remarkjs/react-markdown), I can easily turn my markdown file into HTML page.

## Home Page

### Show an avatar in the center of the page

### Slogan

My slogan is _You are more than what you have become!_. It's from "The Lion King". I want to apply an animation effect to the slogan. Here are some thoughts:

- Use a typewriter animation. Show the whole slogan character by character. Just like there is a typewriter typing the slogan.
- Show the entire slogan from random characters.
